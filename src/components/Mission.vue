        The school of Disciples is a unique school to train the disciples of Jesus Christ. It was
        founded by the help of the Holy Spirit under the Christ the Redeemers’ Ministries, which is
        an evangelical arm of the Redeemed Christian Church of God through our Principal Pastor E .A
        Adeboye who is also the General Overseer of the Church. This unique school is meant to go
        round the world in consonant with the biblical injunction written in (Matt. 28:19).
        “Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
        and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (NIV)”. The whole training is more or less practical
        and direct lectures from the principal (Pastor E.A Adeboye) himself. We will therefore
        recommend this school to all denominations all over the world. Our focus is to make you an
        end time army of Jesus Christ. May you remain heavenly conscious and focus as you go through
        the journey of life
